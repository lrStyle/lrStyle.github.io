        <p>英语的词类优势就是介词，可用介词来扩展词汇的意义。</p>
<p>under 和 underneath：underneath是一个东西<strong>完全</strong>在另一个东西下面，一点都不能露出来；under则只是在下面就可以。因此underneath的适用范围要比under小，但也更具体。</p>
<h2 id="介词的本质"><a href="#介词的本质" class="headerlink" title="介词的本质"></a>介词的本质</h2><p>介词是用来表征对象间关系的，可以表征三种关系：<br><strong>空间关系：</strong>the cat sat on the mat, over his shoulder<br><strong>时间关系：</strong>on Thursday, in November<br><strong>抽象关系：</strong>for your eyes only</p>
<ul>
<li><p>空间关系：是最基本的关系，有点、线/面、体三种形式。<br>点：at the corner，corner可抽象为一个点<br>线：on my way home，way可看成线的关系。<br>面：on the table<br>体：in Shanghai，把上海想成一个大城市，人很渺小，处于这个大城市之中。<br>因此介词的不同反应了老外对后面词画面上的一个观感。</p>
</li>
<li><p>时间关系：是由空间关系引申而来的。<br>点：在某个时间点用at，at that moment, at 9:15。<br>面：面相比点要大一点，用on，on Monday, on the day。<br>体：在一段比较长的时间中，人被时间“包裹”着，in May，in the Stone Age, in 2017，during…。<br>补：因此介词的不同用法可以有不同的修辞功能，比如在周末，美国人用on the weekend/over the weekend；英国人则用at the weekend。这实则表明了两种文化的差异，即英国人比美国人认为周末要短。</p>
</li>
<li><p>抽象关系：同样由空间关系引申而来。<br>on：空间上表“面”，the phone on the table，因此会有一种接触、支撑之意。<br>即引申出来“压迫，背负”的意思：<br>there is a lot of pressure on me，<br>the difficult on them，<br>He is short of brains. He is short on brains. 后一句比前一句有更大的鄙视意味（太short了以至于都压着brains了）。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>of，for，to：<br>to：有方向性，由A到B。外国人一碰到to这个介词，脑海里就会有由A向B的这个方向性。<br>I’m going to China.<br>I give the book to him.<br>Ten to three.<br>I look forward to your reply.<br>I am addicted to the smoking.<br>devoted to learning.<br>reporter should stick to their ethic</p>
<p>for：没有空间意义，更多是抽象意义。和to比，for表示一种授予关系里的接收方，强调授予关系。to强调空间移动，for强调角色的获利关系。<br>The cake is for Tom. 蛋糕是留给Tom的，还未到Tom的手里，只是表明在人们意愿上蛋糕是留给Tom的。<br>Money is important to me.<br>Money is important for me. for比to更为严重，我更加地依赖钱。<br>Smoking is bad for health. health是smoking的“获利方”。<br>I did this for him. 这件事是我为他做的，专门为他做了某事，他属于获利方，强调目的性。<br>I did this to him. 这件事是我对他做的，带有动作的指向之意，多指坏的不好的事情。</p>
<p>talk to &amp; talk with：with在空间中表示“附近”的意思，双方向；to则是单方向。talk with：你一句我一句，to则是单方向一个人讲。</p>
<p>of：of表示一种从属关系，表示不可或缺的一部分。<br>The roof of the house. 房间的屋顶<br>The roof for the house. 屋顶被刮掉了，专门又为这个房间买了个屋顶。</p>
<p>a day for mourning<br>a day of mourning<br>哀悼日的翻译肯定要用第二个，因为第一个仅仅表示这一天是用来哀悼的，哀不哀悼都可以；第二个则表示这一天全天就是哀悼，这一天和哀悼之间的关系更为强烈。</p>
<p>The answer to the question.<br>The answer for the question.<br>The answer of the question.<br>to最为常用，answer和question的关系有点像solution和problem，key和door的关系，有一定指向性的。因此都是solution to the problem，key to the door。</p>
<p>He is like a brother to me.<br>He is a brother of mine.<br>第二个就是指真实的哥哥，第一个就只是像一个哥哥一样。</p>
<p>out of：常可当成独立介词来使用，有from的意思，表示一种动态的过程。<br>He is walking out of the buliding.<br>look out of the window<br>look out the window<br>如果仅表示“向窗外看，那有….”，强调结果，则用look out。若强调人站在屋里向窗外看这个过程（想象视线从屋里“动态”地射向外面），则用look out of。</p>
<p>over：想象一种抛物线的意象，fall over“摔倒”的感觉。</p>
<p>throughout：空间上意象就像穿隧道一样，全程贯穿。</p>
<p>《English preposition explained》</p>
<p>介词虽然能帮助理解，但还是有很多动词+介词构成的动词短语，没有多大规律可言，因此还是要靠长期的积累和记忆。</p>

<h2 id="Part-One"><a href="#Part-One" class="headerlink" title="Part One"></a>Part One</h2><h3 id="Family"><a href="#Family" class="headerlink" title="Family"></a>Family</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Do you have a big family or small family?/How many members in your family?</strong><br>I have a small family, which only includes my father, my mother and I.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Are you close to your family members?</strong><br>Yes, I think I’m very close to my parents. I like sharing the interesting trivias(琐事) that happend to my campus life with my mother. And when I need to make some important decisions, I will discuss them with my father. So my parents give me lots of support and I very love them.<br>(what trivias? what did I dream about last night, recent weather is so hot, like such things)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What do you like to do with your family?</strong><br>Because my hometown is not Wuhan, so I can only make a phone call with my parents to share my campus life when I’m in school. But when holiday comes, my family will have a reunion. And I enjoy watching movie with my parents very much.<br>(what movie? comedy,which can bring us lots of joy and a good mood)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What do your parents do for a living?</strong><br>My mother is a doctor and my father is a company employee.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Is it a good thing to be the only one child in a family?</strong><br>Yes I think it is. Though there is no sibling who can go to school together or catch up on gossip with me, I can do these with my parents, classmates or friends. And having only one child can also reduce the financial burden of my family.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are the good things and bad things of a big/small family?</strong><br>If it is a big family, we will have more intimate persons to share the interesting things in our life. But because there are too many people in family, it will be more likely to happen family conflicts.<br>If it is a small family, we can have more time which only belong to ourselves. And  the financial burden of family will be less. But the bad is that the small family will not be as lively as the big family.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>最喜欢和亲戚/妹妹(younger sister)干的事情</strong><br>go shopping, watch movie, doing sports, go out for dinner, (favourate food–hot pot,It is famous for having lots of pepperies and the hot taste. People gather around a small pot boiled with vegetables, meat, and many other things with delicious soup base)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Friend"><a href="#Friend" class="headerlink" title="Friend"></a>Friend</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Do you have many friends?</strong><br>Yes, I feel that I’m a cheerful boy and I enjoy making friends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Are you good at making new friends?</strong><br>Yes, I think I’m good at it.(How? Firstly, you need to be active. Let others feel that you are an easy-going one. Then, it will be useful to find some common hobbies between you, which will bring many topics you can talk about.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What kind of quelities do you look for in you friends?</strong><br>I prefer the friends who are active and warm-hearted. So we can share with joy and sadness. And when we face some difficult conditions, we can help each other and encourage each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How can you keep in touch with your friend?</strong><br>I prefer to keep in touch by face-to-face communicating, which I think is the best way to express our emotion.  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do you believe friendship can last forever?</strong><br>Yes, I believe that if we can keep in touch with each other usually, the firendship can last forever.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Food"><a href="#Food" class="headerlink" title="Food"></a>Food</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>What kind of food do you like?(favorite flavor?)</strong><br>I like food taste spicy, it’s delicious.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can you cook? Are you good at it?</strong><br>No, I can’t. But I plan to learn how to cook.(Why? I think cooking is an important skill for people. If we cook by ourselves, we can have the food fits us most at any time. And we can also have a well-balanced diet.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do you think cooking is an important skill for people to learn?</strong><br>和上题相同</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What kind of food is popular in China?</strong><br>hot pot. It is popular for having lots of pepperies and the hot taste. People gather around a small pot boiled with vegetables, meat, and many other things with delicious soup base.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do you often have meals with your family? Is it important to have meal with your family?</strong><br>No, because I’m studing in Wuhan but my parents are working in Zhengzhou.(可能会引到家乡相关话题)<br>和家人一起吃饭好处：When we are having meal together, we can chat with each other, which can promote the relationship and maintain bonds with family members.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do you like fast food?</strong><br>No, personally I think it has too much fat and calories, posing a health problem such as obesity, heart disease risk and so on. So I don’t very like it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What kind of food can be classified into healthy food?</strong><br>As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is well-balanced diet. That’s  to say, we should have different kinds of food in a proper protion.For example, we shoule eat some vegetables, and also eat some meat, some furit, and so on, rather than take one single kind of food too much.</p>

<h3 id="Hometown"><a href="#Hometown" class="headerlink" title="Hometown"></a>Hometown</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Where do you come from?Can you tell me something about your hometown?</strong><br>Zhengzhou is an inland city, located in the centre of China. So if you want to go for a travel, it will be very convenient, no matter by train or by palne.<br>And zhengzhou is also a city of inclusiveness and openness, welcoming people from all over the world. I very like my hometown.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>家乡的饮食</strong><br>We like eating noodles, it’s very delicious and convenient. And we can make different flavors of noodles according to our preferences.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>怎么评价郑州的交通</strong><br>Not so good.<br>Because Zhengzhou is developing rapidly, there are many buildings, subway stations being constructed by the roadside, causing some trafiic problems. So if you gou out in rush hour or at weekends, you will be highly likely to meet a traffic jam.</p>

<h3 id="Weather-amp-Season"><a href="#Weather-amp-Season" class="headerlink" title="Weather &amp; Season"></a>Weather &amp; Season</h3><p>I prefer the weather which is cool. If weather is too hot, I will feel very impatient and hardly to work efficiently.<br>My favourite season is autumn. It is cool.<br>When it is spring or autumn, the temperature is at a moderate level, so we can go camping or do most kinds of sports. But when it is summer or winter, the extreme temperature will limit people’s outdoor activities. If it is me, I will prefer to stay at home.</p>
<h3 id="festival"><a href="#festival" class="headerlink" title="festival"></a>festival</h3><p><strong>最喜欢的国内节日：</strong>My favorite festival in China is Spring Festival, when I will be reunited with my parents, my grandparents, my cousins. And we can have a holiday to break from work. We can go shopping, see a movie, sing karaoke, play video games, and so on.<br><strong>最喜欢的国外节日：</strong>Sorry I don’t know much about the foreign festivals. I only konw there will be a great dinner at Thanksgiving Day, including a big turkey. I feel that it must be very delicious.</p>
<h3 id="transportantion"><a href="#transportantion" class="headerlink" title="transportantion"></a>transportantion</h3><p>家乡交通状况：见上文<br>政府采取的措施：limit the amounts of car. If you want to buy car, there will be many restrictions. And the car will also be limited to be driven out one day a week acoording to their car numbers.<br>最喜欢的交通工具（远途）：If I take a long-distance trip, my favourite transportation is train. Since it is very convient. The train station usually locates in the centre of city, while the airport is far away from city. Besides, the price of train tickets is much cheaper than plane tickets. </p>

Could you please repeat it?<br>但也有可能你听不懂问题，是因为问题中存在<strong>生词</strong>，因此当两遍都没听懂时，可以这么表达：<br>So sorry, could you please rephrase（转述） the question?（适合考官态度比较和蔼的情况）<br>Well, my best guess would be…（考官态度不好，就诚实坦白自己没听懂这个问题，接下来的回答都是在猜）</p>

<p>It is well acknowledged that the sector of Computer and Internet is sunrise industry. And after my graduation, there will be a guarantee for my future job hunting.So I could get a well-paid job. </p>
<p>keep in a good shape/live a well-balanced life<br>Because of my program, I have to sit in front of the computer all day long, so I’d better live a healthier life by doing some sports.</p>
<p>My views are as follows:<br>put the xxx on an important position<br>结尾综上所述：above all<br>作文多写点具体的，不要写太虚的东西。</p>
<p>We shouldn’t pay attention to how much money they get, what we should concern about is that if they deserve it.<br>And in my opinion, if one soccer player want to make an achivement, he must train hard, keep shape, have a balanced diet. And he will always be under lots of pressure. So it is not as easy as we think. So I don’t thinks it’s unfair.</p>

        <p>本篇笔记是根据《英语语法新思维初级教程》整理而来。</p>
<h2 id="英文五种基本句型"><a href="#英文五种基本句型" class="headerlink" title="英文五种基本句型"></a>英文五种基本句型</h2><ul>
<li><p>英语句子可分为两部分，<br><strong>主语：</strong>表示我们要陈述的对象，以代词、名词或名词短语来充当。<br><strong>谓语：</strong>说明主语做什么，或说明主语的状况，以动词来充当。<br>因此我们造句时，首先要考虑我们要陈述的对象是什么，写出主语；再考虑主语的动作或状态，写出谓语；再根据谓语动词的不同形式，选用以下五种句型，再填入相应的其他成分，即能造出一个句子了。🍊</p>
</li>
<li><p>主系表<br>I am a boy. 我是一个男孩<br>Learning English is important. 学习英语很重要<br>He looks happy. 他看起来很高兴。<br>补：主系表结构主要用于描述主语的<strong>性质或状态</strong>，由特殊的系动词来连接，<br>常用系动词：<br>look 看起来是<br>sound 听起来是<br>smell 闻起来是<br>taste 尝起来是<br>feel 感觉是<br>seem 似乎是<br>appear 似乎是<br>become 变成为<br>turn 转变为</p>
</li>
<li><p>主谓<br>Internet dating hurts. 网恋有害<br>The fire is burning. 火在燃烧<br>He died. 他死了<br>补：主谓结构主要由<strong>不及物动词（vi）</strong>来引导，动词本身就可表达完整的意思，就不需要宾语了。</p>
</li>
<li><p>主谓宾<br>These children are playing football.<br>I love English.<br>补：最常见的句型，由<strong>及物动词（vt）</strong>来引导，动词本身意思不完整，必须加上动作的施加对象（宾语）来构成完整句子。</p>
</li>
<li><p>主谓+间接宾语+直接宾语<br>Chatting online will give you a lot of fun. 网上聊天会带给你很多乐趣<br>He lent me ten yuan. 他借了我10元<br>I will buy you a meal. 我会请你吃顿饭<br>补：这种句型由<strong>双宾动词</strong>来引导，其后面接两个宾语：间接宾语通常是人，表示动作的接受者；直接宾语通常是物，表示动作的承受者。间接宾语和直接宾语合起来成为双宾语。</p>
</li>
<li><p>主谓宾宾补<br>We can call Internet addicts a Webaholic. 我们可以管上网成瘾的人叫网虫。<br>We elected John our chairman. 我们选举John为我们的主席。<br>I found this answer wrong. 我发现答案是错的<br>You can leave the door open. 你可以把门开着<br>补：这种句型由<strong>宾补动词</strong>来引导，动词后面只接宾语无法表示完整的意思，必须再加上补充说明宾语的补足语来构成。<br>补2:区分双宾语和宾语宾补，看两个词之间是否是修饰关系（可用is连接）-&gt;宾语宾补，还是动词引导的逻辑关系-&gt;双宾语。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>英语中所有句子都是由五种句型演变而来，具体选用哪种是由动词的类型来决定的。</strong></p>

<h2 id="anaconda配置"><a href="#anaconda配置" class="headerlink" title="anaconda配置"></a>anaconda配置</h2><ul>
<li>anaconda是python的一个开源发行版本, 基于condo开发的, 集成了很多常用的数据分析的python包, 还可用来管理python包和开发环境.<br>管理包是指: anaconda可用来方便地安装/卸载/更新包(和pip功能类似).<br>管理开发环境是指: anaconda可以建立不同的开发环境(python2/python3..), 以满足不同的项目需求.<br>anaconda和homebrew区别: homebrew是针对mac的一个包管理软件, 不仅可以安装管理python, 还可以安装管理其他开源软件; anaconda则是python的一个开源发行版本, 针对用python进行数据分析.</li>
<li><p>如何使用ana进行python开发:<br>anaconda默认有一个<code>base</code>环境, 即最基础python的环境(取决于一开始下载的ana版本); 还可以自己再建立其他python环境.<br>在ana中设置好python环境后, VScode中<code>shift+command+p</code>打开命令行, <code>python interprtor select</code>选择相应的环境即可.</p>
</li>
<li><p>安装pytorch: <code>conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch</code></p>
</li>
<li>jupyter文件目录是执行<code>juypter notebook</code>时的目录，和anaconda环境无关。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Eclipse和Tomact配置"><a href="#Eclipse和Tomact配置" class="headerlink" title="Eclipse和Tomact配置"></a>Eclipse和Tomact配置</h2><ul>
<li><p>tomact中运行的项目理论上应该在webapps目录下(表现为出现以项目名作为名字的文件夹)，但这需要eclipse部署才可以，而eclipse默认是不部署项目的，因此需要设置。不设置的话项目是以缓存文件的形式运行在tomact中，并不会出现实体文件夹。<br>配置方法：eclispe底部栏server-双击tomact服务器-serverlocation中选中间项-Deploy path写为wepapps</p>
</li>
<li><p>关于部署jar包，</p>
<ul>
<li>方法1：直接把jar包放到lib目录下。若eclipse设置了自动部署，相关的jar包也会导入到tomact项目，即可方便地以项目为单位进行包管理。自动部署方法<a href="https://blog.csdn.net/supercyclone/article/details/18939473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://blog.csdn.net/supercyclone/article/details/18939473</a></li>
<li>方法2：手动将jar包放到tomact 的webapp/lib目录下</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>项目文件位置：src文件下放java代码，webcontent下放jsp/html/css，webcontent/web-inf/lib下放jar包。</p>
</li>
<li><p>eclipse source-format自动调整代码缩进</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="win10配置"><a href="#win10配置" class="headerlink" title="win10配置"></a>win10配置</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>取消登陆密码：</strong>cmd输入netplwiz，取消勾选“要使用本计算机，用户必须输入用户名和密码”，之后会让你输入一套用户名和密码，每次开机系统即自动用这个账号密码来登陆。若因为某种原因这套账号密码错了，系统就无法自动登陆了，登陆界面还会多出一个账户。</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>如何切换全/半角</strong><br>有时候打字会莫名触发全/半角开关，导致输入字母间变为全角模式，间距特别大。而默认切换全/半角的开关<code>Shift+Space</code>被禁掉了，正常情况win10又只显示一个“输入指示符合”（日期左边），因此要切换全/半角就只能手动调出语言栏：右键日期左边的输入指示符号-显示语言栏-右键还原语言栏-点击那个太阳/月亮符号即可。</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>如何隐藏语言栏</strong><br>右击语言栏符号-高级键盘设置-取消勾选“使用桌面语言栏（如果可用）”</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Windows下如何在当前目录下，打开cmd命令窗口</strong><br>在当前目录下，按下shift + 鼠标右键，会出现“在此处打开命令窗口”的字样，然后点击即可。</p>
